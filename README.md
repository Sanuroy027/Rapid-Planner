# Rapid-Planner
Overview

This project is an interactive web-based decision tree application that helps users get tailored travel recommendations based on their preferences, activities, and budget. Users select options from dropdown menus, and the application generates suggestions for destinations that suit their choices.

How It Works

The user selects preferences for:

Destination type: Mountains or Beach.

Activity type: Adventure or Relaxation.

Budget: Low, Medium, or High.

Upon clicking the "Get Recommendation" button, the application uses predefined templates to generate a travel recommendation based on the selected options.

If any field is left empty, the user is prompted to fill in all the fields before receiving a recommendation.

Users can clear their inputs using the "Clear Inputs" button.

Features

Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple dropdown menus and clear labels make navigation intuitive.

Dynamic Recommendations: Recommendations are displayed dynamically based on user input.

Input Validation: Ensures that users complete all fields before generating a result.

Research

Studied interactive decision tree methodologies to create logical branching for recommendations.

Investigated popular travel destinations and categorized them based on activity type and budget.

Explored best practices for responsive web design and animation for improved user experience.

How to Run

Potential Improvements

Enhanced Recommendations: Integrate APIs (e.g., Google Places, TripAdvisor) to fetch real-time destination suggestions.

Personalization: Allow users to input additional preferences like travel dates, group size, or specific interests.

Improved Styling: Add more visually appealing animations and modern design elements.

Data Storage: Implement backend support to store user preferences and track popular recommendations.

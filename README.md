# Rapid-Planner
Overview

This project is an interactive web-based decision tree application that helps users get tailored travel recommendations based on their preferences, activities, and budget. Users select options from dropdown menus, and the application generates suggestions for destinations that suit their choices.

<h1> How It Works :-</h1>

The user selects preferences for:

Destination type: Mountains or Beach.

Activity type: Adventure or Relaxation.

Budget: Low, Medium, or High.

Upon clicking the "Get Recommendation" button, the application uses predefined templates to generate a travel recommendation based on the selected options.

If any field is left empty, the user is prompted to fill in all the fields before receiving a recommendation.

Users can clear their inputs using the "Clear Inputs" button.

<h1>Features :- </h1>

Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple dropdown menus and clear labels make navigation intuitive.

Dynamic Recommendations: Recommendations are displayed dynamically based on user input.

Input Validation: Ensures that users complete all fields before generating a result.

<h1> Research :- </h1>

Studied interactive decision tree methodologies to create logical branching for recommendations.

Investigated popular travel destinations and categorized them based on activity type and budget.

Explored best practices for responsive web design and animation for improved user experience.

<h1>How to Run:- </h1>

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

<h1> Potential Improvements :- </h1>

Enhanced Recommendations: Integrate APIs (e.g., Google Places, TripAdvisor) to fetch real-time destination suggestions.

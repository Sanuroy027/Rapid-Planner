Overview

This project is an interactive web-based decision tree application that helps users get tailored travel recommendations based on their preferences, activities, and budget. Users select options from dropdown menus, and the application generates suggestions for destinations that suit their choices.

<h1> How It Works :-</h1>

The user selects preferences for:

Destination type: Mountains or Beach and many more.

Activity type: Adventure or Relaxation and many more.

Budget: Low, Medium, or High.

Travelling mode: Bike, Car, Train or Flight.

Upon clicking the "Get Recommendation" button, the application uses predefined templates to generate a travel recommendation based on the selected options.

If any field is left empty, the user is prompted to fill in all the fields before receiving a recommendation.

Users can clear their inputs using the "Clear Inputs" button.

<h1>Features :- </h1>

Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple dropdown menus and clear labels make navigation intuitive.
